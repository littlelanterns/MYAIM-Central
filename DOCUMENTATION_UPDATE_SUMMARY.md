## 📋 Files to Keep vs. Archive

### ✅ Keep (Still Relevant)
- ✅ `BETA_SYSTEM_README.md` - Beta user management
- ✅ `BETA_USER_CREATION_GUIDE.md` - Beta onboarding
- ✅ `SUPABASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Database setup
- ✅ `CODE_RULES.md` - Development guidelines
- ✅ `PHASE1_BETA_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - Recent bug fixes reference
- ✅ `VAULT_CONTENT_README.md` - Implementation guide for Library social/moderation features (complements LIBRARY_SYSTEM.md)

### 🗄️ Archived (Moved to `archive/old-docs/`)
- 📦 `DEBUG_CATEGORY_LOADING.md` - Temporary debug doc (issue resolved in PHASE1_BETA_FIXES_SUMMARY.md)
- 📦 `MIGRATION_TRACKING.md` - Empty tracking log (git history provides better tracking)

## 🔧 Critical Bug Fix: Auth Linking

**Date:** 2025-10-17 (same session)
**Issue:** "How are auth.users linked to family_members?"

### Problem Identified:
The `AuthContext.tsx` was using a **fragile WordPress user ID conversion** to link auth.users to family_members:
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG
.eq('wordpress_user_id', parseInt(authUserId.replace(/-/g, '').substring(0, 8), 16))
```

**Issues:**
- UUID → integer conversion using first 8 characters
- Collision risk
- Bypasses proper foreign key chain
- SQL views also had wrong linking logic

### Solution Implemented:
Use proper foreign key chain via `beta_users` table:
```
auth.users.id → beta_users.user_id → beta_users.family_id → family_members.family_id
```

**Files Fixed:**
- ✅ `src/components/auth/shared/AuthContext.tsx` (lines 126-168)
- ✅ Created `AUTH_LINKING_FIX.md` with full documentation

**Files to Review:**
- ⚠️ `supabase/migrations/001_beta_system_enhancements.sql` (views use old linking)
- Recommended: Create migration `004` to fix SQL views

---

## 🎉 Summary

**Documentation Status:** ✅ Complete and aligned with master vision

**Files Created:** 6 (1 README + 4 system docs + 1 auth fix doc)

**Total Documentation:** ~4,500 lines of comprehensive specifications

**Critical Bugs Fixed:** 1 (auth.users → family_members linking)

**Next Milestone:** Implement missing features based on these specifications

---

**The MyAIM-Central documentation now accurately reflects the vision, architecture, and roadmap for the platform. All stakeholders can reference these docs for implementation, testing, and strategic planning.**

# AIMfM Beta Testing System

## Overview
The Beta Testing System allows you to invite selected users to test AIMfM features before public release. Beta users can upgrade through all subscription tiers (Essential â†’ Enhanced â†’ Full Magic â†’ Creator) using a simple beta code instead of payment.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **File**: `supabase/migrations/001_beta_system_schema.sql`
- **Tables**:
  - `beta_users` - Tracks beta user status and setup progress
  - `feedback_submissions` - Collects user feedback and issue reports
  - `user_activity_log` - Logs user actions for analytics
- **Views**:
  - `beta_user_overview` - Admin dashboard view of beta users
  - `feedback_dashboard` - Admin view of feedback with context

### 2. Authentication & Onboarding
- **Beta Login**: `/beta/login` - Special login for beta users only
- **Forced Family Setup**: `/beta/family-setup` - Required onboarding with flexible options:
  - Solo setup (just the user)
  - Full family setup (partner + children)
- **Auto-redirect**: Incomplete setups are redirected to family setup

### 3. Feedback System
- **HitASnagButton**: Fixed position button on all pages for beta users
- **Feedback Categories**:
  - ðŸ”§ Broken Feature
  - ðŸ¤” Confusing Flow  
  - âž• Missing Feature
  - ðŸ’¡ Suggestion
- **Priority Levels**: Blocking, Annoying, Minor
- **Context Collection**: Auto-captures page, browser info, screen size

### 4. Tier Upgrade Testing
- **BetaUpgradeModal**: Replaces payment flow with beta code entry
- **Beta Code**: Simply enter "beta" to unlock any tier
- **Progression**: Essential â†’ Enhanced â†’ Full Magic â†’ Creator

### 5. Admin Interface
- **Route**: `/beta/admin`
- **Features**:
  - Create new beta users with temporary passwords
  - Monitor user activity and setup progress
  - Review and respond to feedback submissions
  - Manage user status (Active/Suspended/Completed)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
```sql
-- Run the migration file in your Supabase instance
-- File: supabase/migrations/001_beta_system_schema.sql
```

### 2. Required Database Tables
Ensure these existing tables exist (referenced by the beta system):
- `auth.users` (Supabase Auth)
- `families` (with subscription_tier column)
- `family_members` (with wordpress_user_id column linking to auth users)

### 3. Environment Variables
Make sure your `.env.local` has:
```
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

## How to Create Beta Users

### Method 1: Through Admin Interface
1. Navigate to `/beta/admin`
2. Click "Create Beta User"
3. Enter email and generate/set temporary password
4. User receives credentials via secure communication
5. User visits `/beta/login` to get started

### Method 2: Manual Creation  
1. Create user in Supabase Auth dashboard
2. Set user metadata: `is_beta_user: true`
3. Beta user record will be auto-created via trigger
4. Provide login credentials to user

### Admin Access
Only super admins can access the beta management interface:
- tenisewertman@gmail.com
- aimagicformoms@gmail.com  
- 3littlelanterns@gmail.com

## Beta User Experience Flow

### Initial Setup
1. **Login**: User goes to `/beta/login` with provided credentials
2. **Family Setup**: Forced to complete family setup (solo or full family)
3. **Access Granted**: Redirected to main application

### During Testing
1. **"Hit a Snag?" Button**: Always visible to beta users
2. **Feedback Collection**: Easy reporting of issues and suggestions
3. **Tier Upgrades**: Test subscription tiers with "beta" code
4. **Activity Logging**: All actions logged for analytics

### Admin Monitoring
1. **User Overview**: Track setup completion and activity
2. **Feedback Review**: Categorized issues with priority levels
3. **Response System**: Direct communication with beta users
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common issues

## Key Features for Beta Testing

### Feedback Collection
- **Contextual**: Captures page URL, browser info, recent actions
- **Categorized**: Issues sorted by type and priority
- **Actionable**: Admin can respond and track resolution
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies recurring issues

### User Journey Testing
- **Onboarding Flow**: Test both solo and family setup paths
- **Feature Adoption**: Track which features get used most
- **Conversion Funnel**: Monitor upgrade flow between tiers
- **Drop-off Points**: Identify where users get stuck

### Analytics & Insights
- **Usage Patterns**: See how beta users navigate the app
- **Feature Effectiveness**: Track engagement with new features
- **Pain Points**: Real-time feedback on user frustrations
- **Success Metrics**: Monitor completion rates and satisfaction

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- RLS policies protect user data
- Beta users can only see their own information
- Admin access requires elevated permissions
- Feedback submissions are private to user and admins

### Access Control
- Beta access verified on every critical action
- Non-beta users cannot access beta features
- Admin functions require proper role verification
- Temporary passwords encourage immediate password changes

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Database migration applied
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Required database tables exist
- [ ] Admin user has proper permissions
- [ ] Beta login route accessible
- [ ] Feedback system functional
- [ ] Upgrade modal working with "beta" code

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Not authorized for beta testing"**: User not in `beta_users` table
2. **Setup loop**: Check `setup_completed` flag in database
3. **Missing feedback button**: Verify user's beta status in `FeedbackProvider`
4. **Admin access denied**: Check user role and permissions

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Supabase connection
3. Check user's beta_users record
4. Review RLS policies
5. Test with different user roles

## Next Steps

### Phase 2 Enhancements
- Screenshot capture for feedback
- Email notifications for admin responses
- Bulk beta user import
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- A/B testing framework
- Automated issue categorization

### Metrics to Track
- Setup completion rate
- Feature adoption by tier
- Feedback quality and quantity
- Time to issue resolution
- User retention through testing period

This beta system provides a comprehensive testing framework that will help you gather valuable feedback and ensure a smooth public launch of AIMfM.
